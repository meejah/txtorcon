To just install this as quickly as possible, using a Debian or Ubuntu
system, run the following as root:

   apt-get install python-setuptools python-twisted python-ipaddress graphviz

   python setup.py install

Or, instead of installing locally, simply:

   export PYTHONPATH=.



If you want to take slightly more time, but only install temporarily,
use virtualenv:

   apt-get install python-setuptools python-pip
   python setup.py build
   mkdir tmp
   virtualenv --never-download --extra-search-dir=/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ tmp/txtorcon_env
   cd tmp/txtorcon_env
   source bin/activate
   pip install Twisted ipaddress pygeoip     # this will download from internets:
   export PYTHONPATH=../../build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/

(Or you can type "make virtualenv" which creates tmp/txtorcon_env, up
to the "activate" step above)

Now, this should work (where "work" means "prints nothing"):

   python -c "import txtorcon"
