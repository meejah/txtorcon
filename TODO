 . If I want to depend on sphinx-contrib's programoutput then I can
   add this to README to get live results from the tests/coverage
   things:

      .. command-output:: make test
	  :ellipsis: 0,-5
	  :shell:
	  :nostderr:

      .. command-output:: make coverage
	  :ellipsis: 0,-5
	  :shell:
	  :nostderr:

   This also needs a couple changes to doc, in Makefile:

      test:
	     cd .. && make test
      coverage:
	     cd .. && make coverage

   and to conf.py, adding to extensions:

      'sphinxcontrib.programoutput'

 . if we're going with "attribute-style access for everything" then
   also basically everything should be audited for
   this:

      . TorControlProtocol needs some things marked read-only?
      . TorState.set_attacher

 . if we're going with "attribute-style access for everything" then
   Router should be fixed to not contain get_policy() (use policy)
   set_bandwidth, set_flags etc.

 . TorState.build_circuit should return the final Circuit instance,
   not the final EXTEND message (like "EXTEND 1234")

 . put the nginx config for the hidden service somewhere in git; need
   to remember to change the redirect for "-latest" if releasing a new
   version...

 . Looking briefly at "chutney" (tor test-network setup thing) it
   seems to me an improvement on the templates would be: use
   txtor.TorConfig in a mode that allows one to set objects by keys
   (including hidden services, lists-of-strings, etc) and somewhere else
   is code which can start Tor based on a TorConfig -- *after* it
   connects, it does validation on the TorConfig by going through all
   the now-valid Parser objects asking them to validate the
   options. Then, instead of templates which "inherit" from each other
   and have an environment to set up, you have Python types (following
   Builder pattern) which represent the Tors you want to set up so you
   have a Relay class that has a subclass Authority whith the bonus it
   can override anything in Relay. They'd all implement a method in
   something like ITorConfigBuilder that asks it to return a config
   give a Node object (for example, FIXME: look up Builder again).
   For example:

      class ITorConfigBuilder(Interface):
	  def build_config_for(self, node):
	      """return a TorConfig object for the given Node instance"""

      class Relay:
	  implements(ITorConfigBuilder)
	  def build_config_for(self, node):
	      config = txtor.TorConfig()
	      config.SocksPort = 0
	      config.OrPort = node.or_port
	      config.Address = node.ip
	      config.DirPort = node.dir_port
	      return config

      class Authority(Relay):
	  implements(ITorConfigBuilder)
	  def build_config_for(self, node):
	      config = super(self, Relay).build_config_for(node)
	      config.AuthoritativeDirectory 1
	      config.V3AuthoritativeDirectory 1
	      config.ContactInfo = '%d@test.test' % node.number
	      config.ExitPolicy = 'reject *:*'
	      return config

 . use defer.succeed(result) and defer.fail(error) instead of making
   up my own Deferred and calling callback() on it -- more Twisted-like
   I guess?

 . double-double check that i have a utest covering the case of
   multi-line 650 in the midst of a multi-line response OR re-verify
   that this can never happen -- the FSM is right now accumulating in
   only one buffer I believe (after simplifying in commit
   a62dfe0a1511eae717788732de54269920206015)

 . should support CIRC_MINOR event, too (in TorState)

 . Some of the replies from Tor are hugh (e.g. network status) and
   currently I still accumulate them all up into one string and
   subsequently parse that string. The state machine should be expanded
   to be more fine-grained so that, for example, we can parse each
   router descriptor as it arrives (4 lines worth) rather than gather
   all 2000+ router descriptors first, then parse.

 . $B56F17701DC248F8C42150942BDF7A7FAD6C6FC6~Thaolia is in one of my
   circuits, but not showing up in ns/all (nor via ns/id/XX). talked
   about it in #tor a little, but no conclusion. also tried starting
   up a separate Tor and that one also failed to find the key. (And
   possibly triggered my main Tor failing to COOKIE authenticate --
   probably had the cookie file overwritten?)

 - it seems that streams aren't getting set up right if there is
   exactly one right now in tor? via telnet (url changed):

getinfo stream-status
250-stream-status=123 SUCCEEDED 496 www.example.com:6667
250 OK

   fixed, but is this the same for circuits? Probably but hard to have
   precisely one circuit (still, should utest + fix)

 . ICircuitListener and IStreamListener are pretty complicated
   interfaces; might be better to make a simpler interface that is more
   like "pull" Observer pattern with "stateChanged(newstate, **kwargs)"
   or something and an interface on TorController to listen for newly
   created streams and circuits. Could still provide the
   complicated-interface via a multiplex that implemented
   IStreamListener and fanned out to the complicated states.

   This would ease live for clients merely wanting to know, e.g., when
   there are new circuits (or streams).

 . need to interrogate Tor for its bootstrap state when connection, as
   per control-spec.txt
   (e.g. post_boostrap callback shouldn't be issued until both the
   TorController are up and running AND Tor is fully bootstrapped, if
   we connected while it was still starting up). what to do if Tor
   starts bootstrapping (again) while we're running?

 . implement some magic for "getinfo info/names" and "getinfo
   config/names" so that we can do things like:

      con = TorController()
      con.info.process.pid() # same as "GETINFO process/pid"
      con.info.ns.name("OR_Nick") # same as "GETINFO ns/name/OR_Nick"

   or:

      con = TorController()
      con.config.socksport # same as "GETCONF SOCKSPORT"
      con.config.socksport = 1234 # same as "SETCONF SOCKSPORT=1234"

   The config stuff should do the Right Thing so we don't have to do
   the messing around TorCtl does with lists and so forth -- it should
   "just work" for the few values that are magic in the Tor config and
   have to all be set "at the same time".

   See "torplay.py" for a version of the above which works with TorCtl
