txtorcon README
===============

overview
--------

txtorcon is a Twisted-based asynchronous Tor control protocol
implementation. Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written
in Python and Tor is an onion-routing network designed to improve
people's privacy and security on the Internet.

The main abstraction of this library is txtorcon.TorControlProtocol
which presents an asynchronous API to speak the Tor client protocol in
Python. txtorcon also provides abstractions to track and get updates
about Tor's state and current configuration (including writing it to
Tor or disk), along with helpers to asynchronously launch slave
instances of Tor including Twisted endpoint support.

My main motivation to write this was to learn more about Twisted and
Tor. I was playing with pyglet and pygame to try out some
visualization ideas and the only Python controller library was
synchronous (thread-based) so I thought I'd write my own. 


quick implementation overview
-----------------------------

txtorcon also provides a class to track Tor's current state -- such as
details about routers, circuits and streams -- called
txtorcon.TorState and an abstraction to the configuration values via
txtorcon.TorConfig which provides attribute-style accessors to Tor's
state (including making changes). txtorcon.TorState provides
txtorcon.Router, txtorcon.Circuit and txtorcon.Stream objects which
implement a listener interface so client code may receive updates.

txtorcon uses **trial for unit-tests** and has 98% test-coverage --
which is not to say I've covered all the cases, but nearly all of the
code is at least exercised somehow by the unit tests.

    $ make test
    Ran 186 tests in 0.426s

    $ make coverage
    ## ...deleted lots of output...
    covered: 1675
    uncovered: 57
    96.60% test coverage

Tor itself is not required to be running for any of the tests. There
are no integration tests. ohcount claims under 2000 lines of code for
the core bit; around 4000 including tests.

I would also **note** that I was experimenting with underscores
instead of camelCase for the method names; since Twisted is camelCase
it might make sense to switch especially if anyone has strong feelings
on this. On the other hand, it makes it obvious which calls are
Twisted and which are txtorcon.


dependencies
------------

 * [python-ipaddr](http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/): Google's
   IP address manipulation code. Could easily just use string if this
   dependency is a problem; see addrmap.py

 * [twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com): I am working against
   Twisted 11.1.0 on Debian with Python 2.7.2.

 * [GeoIP](https://www.maxmind.com/app/python): provides location information for ip addresses; you will
   want to download GeoLite City from
   [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity) or pay them for
   more accuracy. Or use tor-geoip, which makes this sort-of
   optional, in that we'll query Tor for the if the GeoIP database
   doesn't have an answer but I haven't bothered removing the
   dependency yet..It also does ASN lookups if you installed that
   MaxMind database.

 * [psutil](http://code.google.com/p/psutil/): used in
   util.process_from_address and for guessing Tor's ip
   if "GETCONF process/pid" isn't available.

 * [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/): Only if you want to build the documentation.
   In that case you'll also need something called
   ``python-repoze.sphinx.autointerface`` (at least in Debian) to
   build the Interface-derived docs properly.

 * GraphViz is used in the tests (and to generate state-machine
   diagrams, if you like). If you don't have/want it see
   ``txtorcon/test/test_fsm.py`` around line 62 to disable the test

In any case, on a [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) wheezy or Ubuntu
system, this should work:

    apt-get install twisted python-ipaddr python-geoip python-pydoctor python-psutil graphviz
    apt-get install python-sphinx python-repoze.sphinx.autointerface # for documentation


documentation
-------------

**FIXME** **NOTE** I'm planning to re-organize which .py files the
classes are in. If you know some best practices on this, or have
specific suggestions please email me.

It is likely that you will need to read at least some of
[control-spec.txt](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/control-spec.txt)
from the torspec git repository so you know what's being abstracted by
this library.

There is also a directory of examples/ scripts, which have inline
documentation explaining their use. You may also use pydoc:

    pydoc txtorcon.TorControlProtocol
    pydoc txtorcon.TorState
    pydoc txtorcon.TorConfig

...for the main classes. If you're using TorState, you will also be
interested in the support classes for it:

    pydoc txtorcon.Circuit
    pydoc txtorcon.Stream
    pydoc txtorcon.Router
    pydoc txtorcon.AddrMap

There are also Zope interfaces for some things, if you wish to listen
for events for your own purposes (the best example of the use of these
being TorState itself):

    txtorcon.ITorControlProtocol
    txtorcon.IStreamAttacher
    txtorcon.ICircuitListener
    txtorcon.IStreamListener

For launching Tor and Twisted integration, you will want to look at:

    txtorcon.launch_tor (in torconfig.py)
    txtorcon.TCPHiddenServiceEndpoint (in torconfig.py)
    txtorcon.build_tor_connection (in torstate.py)
    txtorcon.TorProtocolFactory (in torcontrolprotocol.py)


IStreamAttacher affects Tor's behaviour, allowing one to customize how
circuits for particular streams are selected. You can build your own
circuits via ITorControlProtocol.build_circuit(). There is an example
of this called custom_stream_attacher.py which builds (or uses)
circuits exiting in the same country as the address to which the
stream is connecting.


contact information
-------------------

For novelty value, the Web site (with built documentation and so
forth) can be viewed via Tor at https://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion
although the code itself is hosted via git:

    torsocks git clone git://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon.git

You may contact me via meejah@meejah.ca with GPG key
`128069A7 <http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xC2602803128069A7>`_
or see ``meejah.asc``. It is often possible to contact me as
``meejah`` in #tor-dev on `OFTC <http://www.oftc.net/oftc/>`_ but be
patient for replies (I do look at scrollback, so mention my nick).

More conventionally, you may get the code at GitHub and documentation
via ReadTheDocs:

 * https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon
 * http://readthedocs.org/docs/txtorcon/en/latest/

Please do use the GitHub issue-tracker to report bugs. Patches,
comments, criticisms all welcomed and appreciated. See TODO for notes
on deficiencies, planned features, lunatic raving, etc.
