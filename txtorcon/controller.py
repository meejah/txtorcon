    """
    launches a new Tor process, and returns a Deferred that fires with
    a new :class:`txtorcon.Tor` instance. From this instance, you can
    create or get any "interesting" instances you need: the
    :class:`txtorcon.TorConfig` instance, create endpoints, create
    :class:`txtorcon.TorState` instance(s), etc.

    Note that there is NO way to pass in a config; we only expost a
    couple of basic Tor options. If you need anything beyond these,
    you can access the ``TorConfig`` instance (via ``.config``)
    and make any changes there, reflecting them in tor with
    ``.config.save()``.

    You can igore all the options and safe defaults will be
    provided. However, **it is recommended to pass data_directory**
    especially if you will be starting up Tor frequently, as it saves
    a bunch of time (and bandwidth for the directory
    authorities). "Safe defaults" means:

      - a tempdir for a ``DataDirectory`` is used (respecting ``TMP``)
        and is deleted when this tor is shut down (you therefore
        *probably* want to supply the ``data_directory=`` kwarg);
      - a random, currently-unused local TCP port is used as the
        ``SocksPort`` (specify ``socks_port=`` if you want your
        own). If you want no SOCKS listener at all, pass
        ``socks_port=0``
      - we set ``__OwningControllerProcess`` and call
        ``TAKEOWNERSHIP`` so that if our control connection goes away,
        tor shuts down (see `control-spec
        <https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/control-spec.txt>`_
        3.23).
      - the launched Tor will use ``COOKIE`` authentication.

    :param reactor: a Twisted IReactorCore implementation (usually
        twisted.internet.reactor)

    :param progress_updates: a callback which gets progress updates; gets 3
         args: percent, tag, summary (FIXME make an interface for this).

    :param data_directory: set as the ``DataDirectory`` option to Tor,
        this is where tor keeps its state information (cached relays,
        etc); starting with an already-populated state directory is a lot
        faster. If ``None`` (the default), we create a tempdir for this
        **and delete it on exit**. It is recommended you pass something here.

    :param stdout: a file-like object to which we write anything that
        Tor prints on stdout (just needs to support write()).

    :param stderr: a file-like object to which we write anything that
        Tor prints on stderr (just needs .write()). Note that we kill
        Tor off by default if anything appears on stderr; pass
        "kill_on_stderr=False" if you don't want this behavior.

    :param tor_binary: path to the Tor binary to run. If None (the
        default), we try to find the tor binary.

    :param kill_on_stderr:
        When True (the default), if Tor prints anything on stderr we
        kill off the process, close the TorControlProtocol and raise
        an exception.

    :param connection_creator: is mostly available to ease testing, so
        you probably don't want to supply this. If supplied, it is a
        callable that should return a Deferred that delivers an
        :api:`twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol <IProtocol>` or
        ConnectError.
        See :api:`twisted.internet.interfaces.IStreamClientEndpoint`.connect
        Note that this parameter is ignored if config.ControlPort == 0

    :return: a Deferred which callbacks with :class:`txtorcon.Tor`
        instance, from which you can retrieve the TorControlProtocol
        instance via the ``.protocol`` property.

    HACKS:

     1. It's hard to know when Tor has both (completely!) written its
        authentication cookie file AND is listening on the control
        port. It seems that waiting for the first 'bootstrap' message on
        stdout is sufficient. Seems fragile...and doesn't work 100% of
        the time, so FIXME look at Tor source.



    XXX this "User" thing was, IIRC, a feature for root-using scripts
    (!!) that were going to launch tor, but where tor would drop to a
    different user. Do we still want to support this? Probably
    relevant to Docker (where everything is root! yay!)

    ``User``: if this exists, we attempt to set ownership of the tempdir
    to this user (but only if our effective UID is 0).
