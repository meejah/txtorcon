    every one using :meth:`txtorcon.TorState.add_circuit_listener`)

        contains a list of :class:`txtorcon.Router` objects

        instance-variable.

        contains a list of Stream objects representing all streams
        currently attached to this circuit.

        contains a string from Tor describing the current state of the

           - BUILT: all hops finished, can now accept streams
           - EXTENDED: one more hop has been completed

        The reason this circuit was built. Values can currently be one
