class Circuit(object):
    """
    Used by :class:`txtorcon.TorState` to represent one of Tor's circuits.

    This is kept up-to-date by the :class`txtorcon.TorState` that owns it, and
    individual circuits can be listened to for updates (or listen to
    every one using :meth:`txtorcon.TorState.add_circuit_listener`)

    :ivar path:
        contains a list of :class:`txtorcon.Router` objects
        representing the path this Circuit takes. Mostly this will be
        3 or 4 routers long. Note that internally Tor uses single-hop
        paths for some things. See also the *purpose*
        instance-variable.

    :ivar streams:
        contains a list of Stream objects representing all streams
        currently attached to this circuit.

    :ivar state:
        contains a string from Tor describing the current state of the
        stream. From control-spec.txt section 4.1.2, these are:
            - NEW: New request to connect
            - NEWRESOLVE: New request to resolve an address
            - REMAP: Address re-mapped to another
            - SENTCONNECT: Sent a connect cell along a circuit
            - SENTRESOLVE: Sent a resolve cell along a circuit
            - SUCCEEDED: Received a reply; stream established
            - FAILED: Stream failed and not retriable
            - CLOSED: Stream closed
            - DETACHED: Detached from circuit; still retriable

    :ivar purpose:
        The reason this circuit was built. Values can currently be one
        of (but see control-spec.txt 4.1.1):
          - GENERAL
          - HS_CLIENT_INTRO
          - HS_CLIENT_REND
          - HS_SERVICE_INTRO
          - HS_SERVICE_REND
          - TESTING
          - CONTROLLER

    For most purposes, you'll want to look at GENERAL circuits only.


    :ivar id:
        The ID of this circuit, a number (or None if unset).

    :ivar is_built:
        A Deferred that will callback() when this Circuit hits BUILT state.
