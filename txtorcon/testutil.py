    This is a little weird, but in most tests the answer at the top of
    the list is sent back immediately in an already-called
    Deferred. However, if the answer list is empty at the time of the
    call, instead the returned Deferred is added to the pending list
    and answer_pending() may be called to have the next Deferred
    fire. (see test_accept_all_postbootstrap for an example).

    It is done this way in case we need to have some other code run
    between the get_conf (or whatever) and the callback -- if the
    Deferred is already-fired when get_conf runs, there's a Very Good
    Chance (always?) that the callback just runs right away.
