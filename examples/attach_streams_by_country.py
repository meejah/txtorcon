##
## This uses a custom txtorcon.IStreamAttacher to force streams to use
## circuits that exit in the same country (as supplied by GeoIP) and
## builds such a circuit if one isn't available yet.
##
## Note that you can do something very similar to this with Tor's
## config file as well by setting something like:
##
## ExitNodes {us},{ca}
##
## ...in your torrc. The above just exits from those countries, not
## the one in which the Web server is located, however. So, this is a
## little redundant, but gives you the idea of how to do these sorts
## of things.
##
## Another thing to note is that the DNS lookup is a stream before the
## name is looked up, so the DNS lookup may occur from whatever stream
## Tor chose for that (we return None, which causes the attacher to
## tell Tor to attach that stream itself). This presents a problem for
## sites which optimize the server they deliver based on DNS -- if you
## lookup from X you'll get a server near/in X, which for our next
## step will make "the site" appear to be there.
##
## The only "solution" for this would be to do the lookup locally, but
## that defeats the purpose of Tor.
